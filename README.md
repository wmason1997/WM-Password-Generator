I used this link - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7820683/convert-boolean-result-into-number-integer - to figure out how to use the booleans of the included sets to change the length of my for loop afer the hardcoded inclusion of selected sets section.

I met with tutor Sangeetha Kaliaperumal on October 22, 2023 to hammer out the final details of my project.
